Michael- I love your git and Linkedin icon, I struggle with getting mine to display. Great Job

Summer-Wow Trina! Very organized! I love the picture you chose the whole page looks very professional. I also like that you added a personal touch to the about you section. I'm sure you already spotted this but if you use smaller images or make the images display bigger on the page it could reduce the blurryness of the screenshots

Farzana: nice picture Trina ! wow...you have double masters! Apart from this- i like the simplicity of your project. very organized and neat. i would like add that if you are able to scroll down and your links would not move with it- that would have been easier. Every time i wanted to select about/eduaction/contact/etc i had to scroll up. there is a way you can freeze them. that would be helpful.
